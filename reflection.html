            <br>
        <p>My Reflection on Algebra at first, algebra felt somewhat confusing and overwhelming. Balancing equations, factoring expressions, and which seemed a puzzle I was working with inequalities ouldn't solve. But as the semester went on, I began to see the pattern and logic behind each problem.
           I came to realize that algebra isn't all about getting the right answer-it's about understanding the process and thinking step by step. Through activities like solving word problems and Throughout this learning process, especially in simplifying expressions, I learned patience andpersistence. 
           I learned that making mistakes is part of learning, and every mistake is a chance to improve. Algebra has not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also taught me to approach with confidence and a clear mind. Now, I see algebra as more than a subject-it's a tool that exercises my thought processes, strengthens my self-assurance, 
           and prepares me to face problems in school and in life with focus and determination.</p>
